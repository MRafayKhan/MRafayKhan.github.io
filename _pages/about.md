I am a [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/) student in the University Honors  [program](https://www.universityhonors.umd.edu/) as my program at the Honors College. I am currently in school for a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, which I will obtain in May 2022 or December 2021 if I decide to graduate early. I as well have a minor in Business Analytics!
